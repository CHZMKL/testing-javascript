  // After we're done, we're going to put everything back. We'll stop spying

  // So, we've verified that _an_ AJAX call was made, but we don't really know

  // we shoved all of the requests into an array for later inspection. Let's go

// response.

// It turns out, that we can use `sinon.fakeServer()` to catch the requests
// and then respond to them on our behalf. Again, the advantage of this is
// that we don't need to have the server running at all to test this code.
// If you're using Teaspon or something, that's not a big deal as running
// the server is pretty easy and not a big deal. But, Sinon also makes it
// easy for us to mock responses.
